# Time management

### Pareto principle
* "80% of the consequences come from 20% of the causes"
* One must focus on the most important tasks first as they account for 80% of one's work output
* It's a good rule of thumb to decide where best to allocate resources or time


### Eisenhower principle
* One can distinguish between two types of tasks: important and urgent ones.
* "The urgent are not important and the important are not urgent"
* You can rank the most important ones via the following:
    1. Important and urgent
    2. Important but not urgent
    3. Not important but urgent
    4. Neither important nor urgent

# Communication

### Principles
* Everything we do is some form of communication e.g. body language
* The delivery is just as important as the message
* The real message is the one received -- not the one intended

### How does bad communication affect business?
* Loss of potential business and therefore profit
* Mistakes lead to lack of coordination and leads to inefficiency with regards to project completion

### Understanding communication
* Take into account cognitive biases and ensure you are aware of how they affect how you act and communicate etc.
    1. Anchoring bias
        Initial information about a topic dominates further information gained on it i.e. first impressions last
    2. Confirmation bias
    3. Missed a bias here
    4. Authority bias
    5. Bandwagon effect
        A dominating stance makes people more likely to take it; i.e. if 70% of people have their mind made up then people who haven't will be more likely to take it
    6. Outcome bias
  
* Hats:
    1. White hat calls for information known or needed
    2. Yellow hat symbolises brightness and optimism -- you explore positiveness and probe for value and benefit
    3. Black hat is judgement - why something may not work. Spot difficulties and dangers; powerful but a problem if overused
    4. Red hat signifies feelings, hunches and intuition; you can express emotions and feelings and share fears, likes, dislikes, loves, and hates
    5. Green hat focuses on creativity; possibilities, alternatives and new ideas
    6. Blue hat is used to manage the thinking process -- it's the control mechanism that ensures the six thinking hats guidelines are observed

* Dealing with conflict:
    1. Not every situation requires an immediate reaction -- keep a level head and assess it objectively
    2. Ask others for their viewpoints and perspectives
    3. Focus on compromises so that you can satsify both parties 
    4. **Listen** -- understand both points of view and treat them with respect

* Personality types affect relationships with other people
    1. Respect the differences that everyone has and ensure you understand their work ethic and working style
    2. Adapt to everyone accordingly based on their preferred types of communication
    3. Different personalities: extroverts, introverts, supporter, director, analytical
