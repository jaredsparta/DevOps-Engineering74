# Time management

## Pareto principle
* "80% of the consequences come from 20% of the causes"
* One must focus on the most important tasks first as they account for 80% of one's work output
* It's a good rule of thumb to decide where best to allocate resources or time


## Eisenhower principle
* One can distinguish between two types of tasks: important and urgent ones.
* "The urgent are not important and the important are not urgent"
* You can rank the most important ones via the following:
   1 Important and urgent
   2 Important but not urgent
   3 Not important but urgent
   4 Neither important nor urgent
