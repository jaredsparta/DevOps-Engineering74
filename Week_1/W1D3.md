### The process
1. Identify
    * Find the main points of the argument, the claims made, the evidence used, and the conclusions they have reached
2. Analyse
    * Does the evidence really make sense in relation to other research?
    * How old is the material being used?
    * Do you need more information to aid understanding?
    * Does the arguement present a balanced view or are some topics disregarded?
3. Apply
    * Look for the implications of the other information 
    * Look out for weaknesses of the argument and for lack of coverage in the topic

### The three modes of thinking
* Divergent thinking, convergent thinking, and lateral thinking (both)
* Divergent is imagination and convergent is logical -- best to use both
