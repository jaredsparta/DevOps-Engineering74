### 0. Solid foundation
* Core competencies, communication skill, your profile and technical skills all need to be solid, if one is weaker than the others it won't be good

### 1. Presentation Feedback
* Certain colours are more appealing and more rememberable e.g. yellow, red (pay attention to what the background is)
* Try to include pictures for more interaction with viewers -- have images be a good quality so they're readable
* Avoid "/" in headings e.g. "Sprints and Iterations" instead of "Sprints/Iterations"
* CMADE = confidence, manner, attitude, diligence, enthusiasm
* If something is missing, don't highlight it and just continue with your own information

### 2. GDPR
* What is it?
    * The General Data Protection Regulation
    * Came into force on 25th May 2018
    * Gives everyone across the EU protection for their personal data

    * Companies with businesses in the EU must comply with it even if they aren't based in the EU

* Key changes:
    * Increased scope
    * Penalties
    * Consent

* Penalties:
    * If a company breaches the GDPR, there are two tiers of fines:
        1. Up to 20 million or up to 4% of the company's annual turnover -- whichever is greater
        2. Up to 10 million or up to 2% of the company's annual turnover -- whichever is greater
    * Other penalties include:
        * Warnings and reprimands
        * A temporary or permanent ban on data processing
        * Ordering the rectification, restriction or erasure of data
        * Suspends data transfers to third parties


* What constitutes a breach?

    * Controllers
    * Processors
    * Any company that has business in the EU
    * Everyone

* Types of data:

    * Every company must update their privacy policies, by law

* Storing and processing data:

        * Could be lost or damaged and hence should be kept securely and destroyed when obsolete
    * Emails
        * Insecure
    * Spreadsheets
    * Databases

* Databases:
    * When you add someone to a database, that individual has the right to access their information at any time
    * Do not add comments in a database you would not be comfortable saying in person

    * Dispose confidential data securely and safely
    * Protect print-outs

### 3. Cyber Security
* Why is it important?
    * Underpins and protects the core functions of every organisation
    * All staff should be aware of good practices

* Types of attacks:
    * Vishing, smishing, phishing
        * Voice fishing, using sms to gain information, emails that look legitimate to trick users into revealing personal data or downloading malware
    * Impersonation
        * Someone pretending to be someone else
    * Waterholing
    * Malware and ransomware

* Social engineering
Six key principles to be aware of:
1. Reciprocity
2. Commitment and consistency
3. Social proof
4. Liking
5. Scarcity

* Countermeasures
    * Defend against phishing
    * Monitor your digital footprint
