# Normal Forms

**1st Normal Form**

1. Everything is atomic and data cannot be split up anymore.
        - e.g. first_name and last_name NOT just one name
2. No repeating groups

- Each cell should contain a single value
- Each record needs to be unique

**2nd Normal Form**

1. Be in 1NF
2. All non-key columns are fully dependent on the PK.

**3rd Normal Form**

1. Be in 2NF
2. Contains only columns that are non-transitively dependent on the PK.

- What is a transitive dependence?
    - If a column depends upon another column through another column.

- In the example:
    1. 'Bank' is dependent on 'Bank_Code_no' which is dependent on 'ID'. 
    2. Hence there is a transitive dependency between 'Bank_Code_No' and 'Bank' since 'Bank_Code_No' is not the primary key of this relation.
    3. We must create a new table with 'Bank_Code_No' and 'Bank'.

**SQL as a Tester**
- Getting data for testing
- Saving data that is generated from testing acitivities
- Data verifications in DB's
- Testing DB's

**SQL as a DevOps Engineer**
- Environments need DB's (set these up and maintain them)
- Data verifications in DB's and testing DB's

**What we went through**
- SELECT FROM WHERE
- TOP
- COUNT
- DISTINCT
- WHERE
- AND
- OR
- SELECT DISTINCT
- ```sql 
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM table;
    -- This would return the number of distinct countries in the table.
    ```
- IN
- BETWEEN
- AS
- IS
**Wildcards**
- \* is used for everything
- % is a substitute for zero or more characters
- _ is a substitute for a single character
- [charlist] sets and ranges of characters to match
- [^charlist] sets and ranges that DON'T match

- %
    - ```sql
        SELECT name FROM table WHERE name LIKE '%d';
        -- this returns all names in the table that ends with a d
        
        SELECT name FROM table WHERE name LIKE 'Ja%';
        -- returns all names in the table that start with Ja
        ```
- _
    - ```sql
        SELECT name FROM table WHERE name LIKE 'J_red'
        -- if you don't know what letter goes where, use _ as a placeholder

- [charlist]
    - ```sql
        SELECT name FROM table WHERE name LIKE 'h[oa]t';
        -- returns all possible names that have o or a in the middle
        -- return hot, hat BUT NOT hit, het, hrt etc.

        SELECT name FROM table WHERE name LIKE 'h[a-c]t';
        -- returns values with letters a-g in the middle
        -- returns hat, hbt, hct and nothing else

- [^charlist]
    - ```sql
        SELECT name FROM table WHERE name LIKE 'h[^ao]t';
        -- returns everything EXCEPT hat and hot

        SELECT name FROM table WHERE name LIKE 'h[^a-c]t';
        -- returns everything EXCEPT from hat, hbt, hct
        ```
