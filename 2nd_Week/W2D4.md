**More SQL**
```sql
    FORMAT -- used to format dates, phone numbers etc.  into something better
    CONVERT -- used to convert a value into a specified datatype
```

```sql
    --example 1 (puts the current date into that format)
    SELECT FORMAT(GETDATE(), 'dd-mm-yyyy')

    --example 2 (changes the value to a varchar)
    SELECT CONVERT(varchar, 23423.53)
```


**Subqueries**
- It is a nested query within another SELECT statement
- Allows you to take the results of one query and use it in another query
- Can occur in the following clauses:
    1. SELECT (nested subquery - returns one value)
    2. FROM (inline view)
    3. WHERE (nested subqery - returns one value)

```sql
    --example 1
    SELECT CompanyName AS Customer
    FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);

    --example 2
    SELECT OrderID, ProductID, UnitPrice, Quantity, Discount, (SELECT MAX(UnitPrice) FROM [Order Details]) AS 'Max Price'
    FROM [Order Details]
```
