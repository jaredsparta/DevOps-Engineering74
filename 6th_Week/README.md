**What is DevOps**

- An internal culture:
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - Continuous testing
  - Standardised environments
  - Keeps costs low and allows growth to keep peak users in mind

<br>

**Four pillars of DevOps**
1. Ease of use
2. Flexibility
3. Robustness
4. Cost

<br>

# Dev Environments

<br>

**What is it?**
- This is where code runs
- Github is not an environment but virtualenv and computers etc. are environments

<br>

**What are the different ones?**
1. Development environments
2. Testing environments
3. Deployment/Live environments

- Code written will move between these different environments
- The Dev environment should mirror the testing and development environments to the best of it's abilities

<br>

**How to make such environments?**
- We will use Vagrant to create environments
